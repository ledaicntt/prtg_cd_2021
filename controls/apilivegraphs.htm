 <h1>Using Live Sensor Graphs from PRTG in Other Web Pages</h1>
 <p>
  PRTG renders graphs as PNG or SVG files. You can include them in other web pages. The URL for a graph looks like this:
  <ul class="apicalls">
    <li>
      Live Graph as PNG:
      <pre><b>/chart.png</b>?type=graph&width=300&height=160&graphid=2&id=0</pre>
    </li>
	<li>
	  Live Graph as SVG:
	  <pre><b>/chart.svg</b>?type=graph&width=300&height=160&graphid=2&id=0</pre>
	</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
	To switch between PNG and SVG, just change the file extension of <b>/chart</b> to <b>.png</b> or <b>.svg</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> The URL does not start with
    <b>/api</b>
    . For authentication please also add username and password/passhash to the URL.
    When placing these URLs on web pages, keep in mind that the URLs contain the account username and password/passhash.
    This can imply security concerns. We recommend that you set up a dedicated "read-only" user account in PRTG which is member of a
    dedicated user group, for example, that only has "read" rights for the root group and all underlying entries or, even better,
    only for the object ids that are used for graph URLs.

        Allows to control some graph styles:

        Display legend: graphstyling=showLegend%3D%271%27
        <br>
        Hide legend: graphstyling=showLegend%3D%270%27
        <br>
        Control font size: graphstyling=baseFontSize%3D%27XX%27  (xx is the font size)
        <br>
        Control legend and font size at the same time: graphstyling=showLegend%3D%271%27+baseFontSize%3D%275%27
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
      <td>bgcolor</td>
      <td>
        Background color of PNG image, for example, #fffff (value must be URL encoded, for example, %23fffff). This affects the area that surrounds the graph.
      </td>
    </tr>
	<tr class="even">
      <td>plotcolor</td>
      <td>
        Color of graph's plot area, for example, #fffff (value must be URL encoded, for example, %23fffff). This affects the whole area within the graph box.
      </td>
    </tr>
	<tr class="odd">
      <td>plotcolor1</td>
      <td>
        Alternating color of graph's plot area, for example, #fffff (value must be URL encoded, for example, %23fffff). This affects the tiles within the graph box alternating with "plotcolor2". The result is a striped graph box. 
		This parameter is overwritten when using the parameter "plotcolor".

      <td>gridcolor</td>
      <td>
        Color of gridlines in graph's plot area, for example, #fffff (value must be URL encoded, for example, %23fffff). This affects the horizontal and vertical lines within the graph box.
      </td>
    </tr>
	<tr class="even">
	<td>hide</td>
	<td>
	Do not show defined channels in the graph. Use the ID of a channel to hide it. For example, use hide=-4 to not show the downtime channel in the graph. To hide more than one channel, use commas to separate the IDs.

<h2>Retrieving Chart Legends (JSON):</h2>
<p>
  You can show the legend of a sensor graph (channel IDs, colors, units, channel names) in JSON format:
  <ul class="apicalls">
    <li>
      Graph Legend as JSON:
      <pre><b>/api/chartlegend.json</b>?id=sensorid</pre>
    </li>
  </ul>
