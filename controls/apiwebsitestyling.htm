<h1>Styling the Web Interface using CSS, JS, and HTML Injection</h1>
<p>
  PRTG users can use their own logos and/or corporate colors inside the AJAX Web GUI by adding their own HTML and CSS code to PRTG's web interface. For the AJAX Web GUI it is also possible to add your own JavaScript code, too.
</p>

<h2>Limited Support</h2>
<p>
  This feature should only be used by experienced web designers with a good knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Due to the complexity of PRTG's code
  the Paessler support team cannot support you regarding the actual HTML, JavaScript, and/or CSS code that you need to use.
  <br><br><b>Note:</b> New versions of PRTG may render the web pages with a different HTML structure and may require changes for your CSS statements (however, we will try to avoid such situations).
  <h2>How does it work?</h2>

  <p>
    When web pages are created, PRTG uses various include files from the <i>webroot</i> sub folder of your PRTG program directory. You can add your own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by editing the following files for the <b>AJAX Web GUI</b>.
  </p>
  <table cellspacing="0" class="table hoverable">
    <thead class="headersnolink">
      <th>
        <b>Interface</b>
      </th>
      <th>
        <b>Folder and File</b>
      </th>
      <th>
        <b>Contents</b>
      </th>
      <th>
        <b>Will be inserted</b>
      </th>
    </thead>
    <tr class="odd">
      <td>AJAX Web GUI</td>
      <td>webroot\includes\htmlheader_custom.htm</td>
      <td>HTML</td>
      <td>at the top of the page, just after the &lt;BODY&gt; tag</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
      <td>AJAX Web GUI</td>
      <td>webroot\includes\htmlfooter_custom.htm</td>
      <td>HTML</td>
      <td>at the bottom of the page, just before the &lt;/BODY&gt; tag</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
      <td>AJAX Web GUI</td>
      <td>webroot\css\styles_custom.css</td>
      <td>CSS</td>
      <td>at the end of PRTG's CSS file for the AJAX Web GUI</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
      <td>AJAX Web GUI</td>
      <td>webroot\javascript\scripts_custom.js</td>
      <td>JavaScript</td>
      <td>at the end of PRTG's JavaScript file for the AJAX Web GUI</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    The contents of these files are then added at the respective positions. By creating these files and adding your own HTML and CSS statements (e.g. by using a text editor)
    you can append your own HTML and overwrite the built-in CSS statements to change PRTG's look and feel. Custom JavaScript gives you even more possibilities.
  </p>

  <p>
    After adding/changing the file(s) a simple "full reload" of your browser window (Shift-F5) will instantly use the new code and you should be able to see the changes immediately.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> Please only modify the files mentioned above. Changing PRTG's built-in HTML and CSS files is not recommended and not supported.
    All changes to PRTG's other files will be overwritten with new files as soon as a new PRTG version is installed.
  </p>

  <h2>Writing CSS Code</h2>

  <p>
    For some common redesign tasks (colors, logos, margins) we have included sample statements in the CSS code below. If you have additional design requirements
    we recommend that you use a tool like
    <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">FireBug</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/">Chrome Developer Tools</a> or any other web page analyzer tool to dig into
    PRTG's existing HTML code structure and CSS statements in order to find out what CSS statements you must add/change.
