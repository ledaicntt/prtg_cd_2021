  An Important Note About Technical Support Regarding API Features
</h2>

<p>
  Working with PRTG's API can quickly become a technical challenge and it is no everyday task.<br/>
  In most cases the knowledge of an experienced software developer or web developer is required to work with the API.<br/>
  All API features described on this page as well as their usages are not covered by Paessler's usual next-business-day support.<br/>
  So please understand that it may take a few days to receive an answer to inquiries about API features from Paessler Support.<br/>
  In general we cannot provide support for web design issues involving your own CSS and HTML.<br/>
