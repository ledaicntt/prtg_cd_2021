<p>Here is a note from your PRTG Network Monitor server: your PRTG Network Monitor server does not run on one of the most recent versions of Windows. Therefore you may experience PRTG slower than it can actually be.</p><br />
For your best monitoring experience with PRTG we recommend <strong>Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 or later</strong> for PRTG Core Service and Probe Service.<br /><a href="https://www.paessler.com/manuals/prtg/detailed_system_requirements?utm_source=prtgtrial&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=m-thread&utm_content=mttTrial_Day4_Server_OS_not_recommended#os
">For details please see our system requirements</a>.</p><br />
<p>By moving to Windows 2012 R2 or later you can improve especially the monitoring performance via WMI <strong>up to factor of 10</strong>.<br /><a href="http://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/64331-for-which-sensor-types-do-you-recommend-windows-server-2012-r2-and-why?utm_source=prtgtrial&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=m-thread&utm_content=mttTrial_Day4_Server_OS_not_recommended">Please see our Knowledge Base for which sensor types we recommend Windows Server 2012 R2 and why</a>.</p><br />
