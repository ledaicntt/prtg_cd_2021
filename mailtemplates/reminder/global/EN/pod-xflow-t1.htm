<title>Monitoring bandwidth via flows</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Here is a note from your PRTG Network Monitor server: you are currently monitoring with <strong>xFlow</strong> (NetFlow, IPFIX, sFlow, jFlow) sensors. Did you know that PRTG provides several flow sensors to monitor the bandwidth in your network?</p><br />
<p>Everything you need to know about <strong>flow monitoring with PRTG</strong> can be found in our manual:<br />
<a href="https://www.paessler.com/manuals/prtg/flow_monitoring?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=m-thread&utm_content=mttTrial_Flow">www.paessler.com/manuals/prtg/flow_monitoring</a>
</p><br />
<p>PRTG also provides you with a <strong>Toplists view</strong> for all xFlow sensors.  This way PRTG is able to tell which IP address, connection, or protocol uses the most bandwidth. Check it out here:<br /><a href="https://www.paessler.com/manuals/prtg/toplists?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=m-thread&utm_content=mttTrial_Flow">www.paessler.com/manuals/prtg/toplists</a></p><br />
<p>Thanks for using PRTG!</p>
