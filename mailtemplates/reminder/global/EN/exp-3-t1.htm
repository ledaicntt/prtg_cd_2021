<p>Hi, my name is Dirk Paessler and I am the CEO at Paessler.</p><br />
<p>Your free PRTG trial expired a few days ago.</p>
<p>Do you need any help to get the most out of your installation? Do you have any questions? Or PRTG did not help to solve your problems?</p><br />
<p>I am curious why you don't love PRTG as much as I do.</p><br />
<p>I would really appreciate your feedback. Just drop me an email at <a href="mailto:ceo@paessler.com">ceo@paessler.com</a>.</p><br />
<p>Thank you!</p><br />
<p>PS: Yes, I really am the CEO, and yes, I really do respond to everyone who writes me.</p>
