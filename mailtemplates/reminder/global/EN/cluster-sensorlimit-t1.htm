<title>Sensor count recommendation for PRTG cluster reached</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Here is a note from your PRTG Network Monitor server: <span style="color:d71920;"><strong>currently you are using <#objectstatus name="totalsens" show="textraw" id="0"> sensors in a cluster</strong></span>. This is above our recommended sensor count. While we support up to 5,000 sensors in a cluster, our recommendation is to stay below 2,500 sensors. If you want to monitor more than 2,500 sensors in a PRTG failover cluster and experience any performance issues, we kindly ask you to <a href="mailto:presales@paessler.com?subject=PRTG%20Cluster%20Sensor%20Count">contact our Presales Team</a> for consultation.</p><br />
<p>Please see our <a href="https://www.paessler.com/manuals/prtg/detailed_system_requirements?utm_source=prtgtrial&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=m-thread&utm_content=mttCommercial_Reaches_5k_Sensors_Cluster#size">system requirements</a> for size recommendations and read our article on <a href="http://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/26383-planning-large-installations-of-prtg-network-monitor?utm_source=prtgtrial&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=m-thread&utm_content=mttCommercial_Reaches_5k_Sensors_Cluster">planning large installations</a>.</p><br />
<p>We recommend a single <a href="https://www.paessler.com/manuals/prtg/clustering?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=m-thread&utm_content=mttCommercial_Reaches_5k_Sensors_Cluster">failover setup</a> if you need fail-safe monitoring. This consists of two PRTG core servers, each working as a cluster node. <br />
In a PRTG failover cluster, the monitoring load doubles with each cluster node, so you will encounter half performance for each additional cluster node.</p><br />

<p>Thanks for using PRTG!</p>
