<title>Why you should renew your PRTG maintenance</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Here is a note from your PRTG Network Monitor server: <span style="color:d71920;"><strong>your maintenance for PRTG Network Monitor has expired a while ago</strong></span>. Security leaks are found in network software all the time (e.g. Poodle, Heartbleed, Shellshock). We usually publish security fixes for PRTG in a matter of days after becoming aware of them. But if you don't have maintenance you cannot get these updates together with all the improvements and new features that we add every month!</p><br />
<p><strong>We recommend to renew your maintenance and update to the latest version of PRTG Network Monitor.</strong></p>
